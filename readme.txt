kNN-Algo is part of my second assignment at University where I am tasked with creating an algorithm that can calculate
the Euclidian Distance between 2 points of given data. Alongside this, the most marks of the assignment derive from our
own improvements to our algorithm.

This means this is the first piece of code where I will be utilising versions and keeping track of changes made to
my code.

Version 0.1 (18/11/23)
    Simple implementation. Not very optimised.
    For example, I have 2 blocks of while and for loops to read the data inputs and put each individual value into arrays.
    I believe this can be made more optimal if I can find a way to use one block of code to read both inputs.
