kNN-Algo is part of my second assignment at University where I am tasked with creating an algorithm that can calculate
the Euclidian Distance between 2 points of given data. Alongside this, the most marks of the assignment derive from our
own improvements to our algorithm.

KNN1 was the first attempt at trying to calculate the accuracy of the distance calculations. It has a predicted accuracy of around 48% which isn't great but good because the data it was tested on
meant that for the algorithm to work correctly you could only initially get 48% maximum accuracy.

I then began testing on a larger set of data and included the implementation of Z-Score Standardisation in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm to 98%.
